Basic implementations of useful stuff:
- SimpleThreadPool: a thread pool that runs tasks implementing a Runnable interface (java inspired);
- Queue: a thread safe queue data structure;
- Stack : a thread safe stack;
- Transactional stack: a transactional stack that piles transactions (collections of push-pop operations).
